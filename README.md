# 🛡️ Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption



A simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, a classical encryption technique that shifts letters by a fixed number (the *shift key*).  
This project supports both **encryption** and **decryption**, handles uppercase & lowercase letters, and preserves spaces and punctuation.

---

## 📜 Overview

The Caesar Cipher works by replacing each letter with another letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

- **Encryption** → Moves letters *forward* by the shift key.
- **Decryption** → Moves letters *backward* by the shift key.
- Non-alphabet characters are left unchanged.

Example:
```
Text:       Hello World
Shift:      3
Encrypted:  Khoor Zruog
Decrypted:  Hello World
```

## 📌 Example Usage

**Encryption**
```
Enter your text here please: Hello World
Enter the shift number please: 3
if you want to encrypt type e and if you want to decrypt type d: e
Encrypted Text: Khoor Zruog
```

**Decryption**
```
Enter your text here please: Khoor Zruog
Enter the shift number please: 3
if you want to encrypt type e and if you want to decrypt type d: d
Decrypted Text: Hello World
```
